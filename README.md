# Magical Girl Storms The Castle!
A game made for Ludum Dare 47 : "Stuck In A Loop"

## Design

I didn't really like the theme as it was, so I decidede to try taking it a few steps further. The game itself doesn't have "Stuck In a Loop", but I'm hoping the players themselves find themselves stuck in a loop. I attempted this with mechanics that encourage kiting as a dominant strategy (which is best done in circles for this game) and also by simply permitting the players to complete a simple level repeatedly with different difficulty levels.
